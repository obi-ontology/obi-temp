OBI:0002117	whole genome sequencing assay	A DNA sequencing assay that intends to provide information about the sequence of an entire genome of an organism.	"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827230, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23095910"	"WGS permits comprehensive sequencing of introns and exons, whereas whole exome sequencing (WES) allows deeper sequencing of exonic regions at a lower cost. Due to the large number of genetic variants found in each genome, it is necessary to use filtering approaches to distinguish deleterious from benign variants. WES has been used successfully to identify novel genetic causes of primary immunodeficiency. Complex structural variations and non-Mendelian disorders remain challenges for WGS."	ImmPort	Genotyping assays should ideally identify which part of the genome the information is about. We do not currently have a good way to do this. That information should be added later.

OBI:0002118	exome sequencing assay	A DNA sequencing assay that intends to provide information about the sequence of the protein coding components of a genome (exons).	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25827230	"DNA was extracted from the Ficoll pellet of blood taken from congenital asplenia patients. Unamplified, high-molecular weight, RNase-treated genomic DNA (4_6 _g) was used for whole exome sequencing (WES) with the use of Agilent 71 Mb (V4 + UTR) singlesample capture and an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Sequencing was carried out so as to obtain 30_ coverage from 2 _ 100-bp paired-end reads. We used the Annovar tool (25) to annotate the resulting highquality (HQ) variants. In the regions targeted by WES capture (81.5% of the consensus coding genome), the mean numbers of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels) detected per sample were 84,192 and13,325, respectively. After filtering, a mean of 74,398 (95.3%) high-quality (HQ) SNVs and 9,033 (70.6%) HQ indels were called. A mean of 105 coding HQ SNVs and 32 indels was identified."

The stained samples were examined for signs of pathological changes under light microscopy."	ImmPort			equivalent		imaging assay						microscope				
OBI:0002120	mixed lymphocyte reaction assay	"A cytometry assay where lymphocytes from two individuals are co-cultured with the lymphocytes from one of the allogeneic individuals (Responders) being labeled (with 3H Thymidine or BrdU) and the proliferation of the labeled cells is measured, which is thought to reflect recognition of histocompatibility antigens on the unlabeled cells (stimulators)."	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14969764	"T cells were separated from PBL of laboratory volunteers and used as responder cells (R). Mitomycin C-treated allogeneic mAPC enriched populations were used as stimulators (S), incubated for 5 days, pulsed with 3H-thymidine (3H-TdR) for 16 hours, harvested, and radioactivity counted using a beta scintillation counter to measure proliferation of the 3H-thymidine labeled cells."

OBI:0002121	killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor typing assay	A genotyping assay in which the alleles of genes encoding for killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors are determined.	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21239231	"DNA was isolated from PBMCs from healthy donors.The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay was performed on an HT7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) following the allelic discrimination assay protocol provided by the manufacturer. Primers for the assay were designed in such a way that they amplified all the alleles of a particular HLA type (HLA-B or HLA-C) as well as the amplicon containing the polymorphic region of interest. Two probes were designed with a single mismatch between them. Each probe bound only one group of alleles and was labeled with either 6FAM or VIC fluorescent dye at its 5_ end. The 3_ end of the probes contained a quencher. For KIR2DL1 functional allele typing, the probe was designed based on a single-nucleotide mismatch at amino acid position 245 in the mature protein. A universal primer was designed that could specifically amplify all the alleles of KIR2DL1.The SNP assay was run on the HT7900 using the same protocol as described for KIR ligand typing. Results showed that 20 individuals had only arginine at amino acid position 245 of KIR2DL1, 5 were heterozygous for arginine and cysteine, and 1 had only cysteine in that position.Thus, this approach was useful not only for the identification of functional groups of KIR alleles, but also for determining the presence of the KIR gene itself."

OBI:0002122	major histocompatibility typing assay	A genotyping assay in which the alleles of genes encoding for major histocompatibility complex molecules are determined.	"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27516207, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2628004/"	"Blood samples from Holstein-Friesian heifer calves were used to isolate white blood cell (WBC) pellets, from which total RNA was extracted using Tri-reagent and cDNA generated using a Reverse Transcription Kit, both  according to the manufacturers? instructions. An alignment of sequences of known bovine MHCI gene cDNAs, as presented in the IPD-MHC database (May 2014), was used to design a series of 3_ (for) and 5_ (rev) pan-MHCI primers. cDNA from individual animals was subject to PCR amplification in two separate reactions using either the For1/Rev2 or the For3/Rev1 primer pairs. For each sample primers using a unique combination of MID tags were used to allow subsequent de-multiplexing of the sequence data. PCRs were conducted using the Phusion High-Fidelity PCR kit. Following amplification, 5?_l of PCR products from each sample were pooled, purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads and run on a 1.5?% agarose gel. Bands of the appropriate size  were extracted and purified using the Qiagen Gel extraction kit. Libraries were submitted to Edinburgh Genomics where after standard quality control procedures they underwent 300 base paired-end sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq v3. Data were separated into reads generated from For1Rev2 and For3Rev1 primer pairs, generating separate datasets for up to 192 samples. Within each sample, reads were clustered into unique variants which were subsequently compared using BLAST against a database of the previously identified bovine MHCI sequences. This process identified >140 novel classical MHCI genes and defined 62 novel MHCI haplotypes, dramatically expanding the known bovine MHCI repertoire."
